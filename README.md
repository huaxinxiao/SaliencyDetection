# SaliencyDetection
### Introduction

This is the implementation of our work ` Dense Connections for saliency detection`.

This method is also used to generate the background pseudo-labels for our work `Revisiting Dilated Convolution`.

### Pre-trained Models
- [SNet](https://drive.google.com/open?id=16tT2FjFQFpAL7hXqbY5M30Jv6sZA3VJX), pre-trained by VGG16.

- [SNet+](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1MeIgLB1TKk9dYLEwdmaqtD6vhsLlXXU4), pre-trained by ResNet101.

### Results
The pseudo-labels generated by our CVPR18 paper can be downloaded from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/19t-Vz0Z2KqhIU47e5B3_JqCemvtJOeSp/view).
